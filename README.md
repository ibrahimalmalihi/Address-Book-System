# Address-Book-System

A robust, interactive command-line application built with **Python**. This project showcases high-level logic for managing data, searching with "similar name" suggestions, and handling user errors.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Smart Search**: Find contacts by name or number with a built-in "Suggested Names" algorithm for typos.
- **Categorization**: Group contacts into (Family, Personal, Work, or Other).
- **Data Integrity**: Validates phone numbers (numeric only) and prevents duplicate entries.
- **Full CRUD Support**: Add, Search, Show All, and Delete contacts with ease.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlight
I implemented a **fuzzy search logic** (similar matches) that detects if a name is off by only one character—this is a foundational concept in **Data Science** and information retrieval.
